# Dimensionality-Reduction.
## Dry Bean Dataset Analysis.

### Project will test the concept of Dimensionality Reduction

- Seven different types of dry beans were used, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. 

- A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions, and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.

- Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00602/

- File: (DryBeanDataset.zip â€“ Use Dry_Bean_Dataset.xlsx)

- You are expected to provide solution that answers the below mentioned questions:
a) Plot the first two dimensions PCA.

b) Use the first n PCA which 95% variance covered as inputs to apply classification algorithms, present, TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Confusion matrix and Classification rate.

c) Compare the classification results from b) with the results with original features.

d) Apply the most optimal classification algorithm of your choice and mention reasons why you choose this method and give the conclusions.

- Requirements:
Analysis of results, meanings and data set conclusions
